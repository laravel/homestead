Please note that the Homestead issue tracker is reserved for bug reports and enhancements. We are not always able to debug Vagrant, Provider or Operating System issues, but will do our best to help. Thank you!

## Versions
  - Vagrant: Run `vagrant -v` to show the version.
  - Provider: Virtualbox, VMWare or Parallels and its version.
  - Homestead: Run `homestead --version` to show the version.

**A lot of issues can be resolved by simply updating vagrant, provider or homestead.**
>**Note:** Virtualbox users, please upgrade to `~5.1`. You *will* show as up-to-date from the `~5.0` branch when you `About -> Check for Updates`. You'll need to download a newer version of [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

## Host operating system
This is the operating system that you run locally.

## Homestead.yaml
```yaml
# Copy-paste your Homestead.yaml here
```

## Vagrant up output
Provide a link to a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) containing the complete output.
Do **NOT** paste the debug output in the issue, just paste the link to the Gist.
